# Printers

*Printers* are *host* programs that receive log data, format it and display it.
The following printers are currently available:

- [`probe-run`], parses data sent over RTT (ARM Cortex-M only).
  > ğŸ’¡ If you are using the git version of defmt, make sure you also install the tool from git and not crates.io.
  
  Since v0.3.3, `probe-run` has now a [`--json`] flag to format the output. The main goal of `--json` is to produce machine readable output, that can be used to changing the human-readable format, a question [addressed here] for example.

- [`defmt-print`], a generic command-line tool that decodes defmt data passed into its standard input.
- [`qemu-run`], parses data sent by QEMU over semihosting (ARM Cortex-M only).
  > ğŸ’¡ Used for internal testing and won't be published to crates.io
